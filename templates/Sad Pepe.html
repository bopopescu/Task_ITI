A green anthropomorphic frog with a humanoid body, Pepe originated in a comic by Matt Furie called Boy's Club.[2] It became an Internet meme when its popularity steadily grew across Myspace, Gaia Online and 4chan in 2008. the character's image had been appropriated as a symbol of the alt-right movement.[7][8] The Anti-Defamation League included Pepe in its hate symbol database but wrote that most instances of Pepe were not used in a hate-related context.[9][10] Since then, Pepe's creator has expressed his dismay at Pepe being used as a hate symbol and has sued organisations for doing so.[11] In 2019, Pepe was used by protesters in the Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests as a symbol of liberty and resistance.</p></div></div>{% endblock %}
